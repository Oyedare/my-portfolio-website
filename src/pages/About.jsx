          <p>Creating a unique style for myself in the digital space via my creative mind is what I crave, so much so that someone could easily tell I worked on a project just by looking at it.</p>
          <p>Its a goal that's still in the workings, over the years I've worked as a developer with various other talented individuals and on different projects that broadened my knowledge and set a clearer picture of where I'm headed.</p>
          <p>I've learnt how to use many digital technologies that are high in demand on the market as we speak. I also learnt how to satisfy a project's need by analyzing the task; highlighting the problems and learning how to solve them effectively.</p>
          <p>I tend to be a stickler most of the times and can spend hours typing away on the keyboard till I get the results I desire (it's very stressful sometimes üò©).</p>
          <p>If you don't find me  glued to my laptop screen spoiling my  eyesight from radiation, then I'm probably watching a Manchester United Match. ü§ß‚ù§Ô∏è </p>
